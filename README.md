## Project 3
### [Build an Interactive Form](https://tjaysteno.github.io/P03-interactive-form/ "See it now")

In my third Tech Degree project, I have created the validation logic for an interactive form. This form dynamically responds to a user's actions in a number of ways; as an example, it hides or displays fields like "Other Job Title" and the credit card payment section until needed. During workshop registration, my code notifies users when their class runs concurrently to another and won't allow a user to select two concurrent classes. Finally, the form validates in real time as a user makes their way through the form, in some cases even as the user is typing. I have used jQuery in this project once again, just to reinforce what I learned on the last project.

*__Skills:__ HTML forms, CSS, DOM Scripting, jQuery*

*__Personal Development Emphasis:__ self-contained code, concise comments, helpful names for variables & functions*

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "You've done it again! Project 3 was a beast in that it required more code than projects 1 & 2 combined. When students take on this project they usually don't expect to have to put in so much effort, but that's the Treehouse way of giving you the best education on modern coding practices. Your work here is proof that you're more than ready the difficult stuff.

"In addition, you're well-prepared to review student projects! For each project you complete, try grading at least one. Reading and debugging will grow and solidify those skills you already have, as well as teach you methods you otherwise would not know of. So try it out: go to the Peer Review tab and choose a project that you see are open for review!"
