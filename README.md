## Project 3
### Build an Interactive Form

In this third project, I will be creating the logic for an interactive form. This form will dynamically respond to a user's actions; displaying elements such as t-shirt color options and input fields for credit card information. In workshop registration, it will notify users when their class runs concurrently to another and disallows the other until the first is unselected. Finally, if at any time the information provided will not validate, the page will immediately ask the user to correct the information before the form can be submitted. I will be using jQuery once again for this project in order to practice.

*__Skills:__ HTML forms, CSS, DOM Scripting, jQuery*

*__Personal Development Emphasis:__ self-contained code, concise comments, helpful names for variables & functions*
